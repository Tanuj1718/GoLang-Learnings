Week 1:


Why?

•	It is a strong and statically typed language means each variable has a type.

•	Go is designed for faster compilation without the need for dependency checking. No libraries or framework is  used, so no dependency.

•	It has a lot of string functions to manipulate string, also it has concept of garbage collection.

•	Concurrency: It is related to multitasking, means whenever any memory gets free, the next task will be executed. The task is not dependent to each other.

           GO = C + strings + garbage collection + concurrency

•	Products or tools on Go: Docker, Kubernetes, Ethereum etc.


* If we have to use different packages in different files, then we have to keep them in different folder. It is because Go follows strict file structure. It means we can use only one package in a folder of different files. 
Refer my_package folder for above.
